## Introduction

<strong>What are design tokens?</strong>
<p>
  Design tokens are all the values needed to construct and maintain a design
  system — spacing, color, typography, object styles, animation, etc. —
  represented as data. These can represent anything defined by design: a color
  as a RGB value, an opacity as a number, an animation ease as Bezier
  coordinates. They’re used in place of hard-coded values in order to ensure
  flexibility and unity across all product experiences.
</p>

<p>
  Design tokens are directly integrated into our component libraries and UI
  kits. They cover the various options of platform scales, color themes,
  component states, and more.
